### Jupyter notebooks

Please install [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution){:target="_blank"}.
This is free software available for Mac, Linux, and Windows. A part of the Anaconda distribution is the Jupyter Notebook app.  It can be launched by typing `jupyter notebook` in a terminal (on Mac and Linux)  or command prompt (on Windows). Once you execute
this command, a web browser will open showing Jupyter Notebook dashboard.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJnro9jQ3fE) is a video by prof. Lorena Barba
from GWU that demonstrates basic functionality of Juptyer Notebook.
