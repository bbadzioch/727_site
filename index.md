## Lectures

| **Office Hours:** by appointment |


## Prerequisites

A large part of this course will depend only on the material covered in MTH 428/528 (CW complexes, 
the fundamental group, covering spaces). Later, we will also use homology and cohomology to the extent 
covered in MTH 628. 

## Learning outcomes

The goal of this course is to introduce some more standard material in homotopy theory:

* Higher homotopy groups
* Fibrations and fiber bundles
* Cofibrations
* Weak equivalences
* Spectral sequences

## Textbook

This course will not follow closely any specific textbook, but there are several good texts 
that cover this material. For example:

* [Allen Hatcher, *Algebraic Topology*, Cambridge University Press 2001](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/#ATI)
* [Tammo tom Dieck, *Algebraic Topology*, European Mathematical Society 2008](https://ems.press/books/etb/57)


## Homework

Homework problems will be assigned periodically. Submitting homework is optional.


## Weekly digests

Each week you will be asked to submit a short (a few sentences long) writeup
on your study from the previous week. For example, you can write:

* what topics you have found interesting (or boring)
* what topics you have found difficult (or easy)
* how  you feel about the course
* anything else you want to share.

You will be also asked to submit a question (or questions) that you would like to
see discussed during a class meeting. 


## Exams

There will be no exams in this course.
